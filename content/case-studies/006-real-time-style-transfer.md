## How it works

In this app I'm implementing this [paper](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jcjohns/papers/eccv16/JohnsonECCV16.pdf) "Perceptual Losses for Real time style tranfer and super resolution" in **PyTorch**.

The goal is to show how to transfer the style of a painting onto an image. Directly.  

The rest of the app is developed in **HTML**, **CSS** for the front-end and **Flask** for the back-end. Details in the youtube vide above.


## Code 

Coming soon.
